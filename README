applecl-encoder
---------------
This tool was originally intended to produce SPIR 1.2 compatible LLVM bitcode from LLVM 3.5 bitcode.
-> https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIR-Tools

Since Apple's OpenCL binary format in OS X 10.9 and 10.10 is based on some mixture of LLVM 3.2 and 2.8, the original spir-encoder tool has been enhanced to support/output a bitcode binary in this format (bitcode version 0). The differences between LLVM/SPIR 1.2 and Apple's 3.2 format are otherwise relatively minor.

This tool also uses code from http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/llvmCore/ and http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.5.1
In particular, it is currently based on http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/llvmCore/llvmCore-3425.0.34.tar.gz and http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.1/llvm-3.5.1.src.tar.xz


How To Build with LLVM
----------------------
1. copy "applecl-encoder" directory to [llvm3.5-path]/tools/
2. add applecl-encoder to [llvm3.5-path]/tools/LLVMBuild.txt and [llvm3.5-path]/tools/Makefile
3. build LLVM
